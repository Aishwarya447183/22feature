    "##Q1.To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, you would need a set of paired observations for the amount of time students spend studying and their corresponding final exam scores. Let's assume you have collected such data for a group of students. Here's how you can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and interpret the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean (average) of the time spent studying and the mean of the final exam scores.\n",
    "Calculate the difference between each individual time spent studying and the mean of the time spent studying, as well as the difference between each individual final exam score and the mean of the final exam scores.\n",
    "Multiply each pair of differences obtained in step 2.\n",
    "Sum up all the products obtained in step 3.\n",
    "Calculate the standard deviation of the time spent studying and the standard deviation of the final exam scores.\n",
    "Multiply the standard deviations obtained in step 5.\n",
    "Divide the sum of products obtained in step 4 by the product of the standard deviations obtained in step 6.\n",
    "The result of step 7 is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which will be a value between -1 and 1.\n",
    "Interpreting the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the time spent studying and the final exam scores. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores also tend to increase.\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship between the time spent studying and the final exam scores. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the final exam scores tend to decrease.\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 0, it indicates a weak or no linear relationship between the time spent studying and the final exam scores. This means that there is no consistent pattern or trend between the two variables.\n",
    "Remember that the Pearson correlation coefficient measures only linear relationships, so it may not capture other types of relationships, such as nonlinear or non-monotonic relationships. Additionally, correlation does not imply causation, so even if there is a strong correlation between the variables, it does not necessarily mean that studying directly causes higher exam scores. Other factors may also influence the relationship.\n",
